# Logger
This code create a log file and it stores the data in it. (it also checks for the directory and eventually create one)
Use this code in your scripts to make sure their execution are tracked and saved in a file

P.S. there are two version of the code
- Logging.py : this is a complete implementation of the logging funtion. It has 4 levels (info, warning, error, debug)
- LoggingNoDebug.py : this a quick implementation of the logging function. It uses the built-in specific functions for indicating the log levels and don't have the debug option
